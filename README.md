# Oink!

Making the web a more considerate place and highlighting the empathetic important of designing for access.

More often than not, the web can be difficult to navigate and not friendly for all users with different preferences and needs. For example, many images on the web are missing alt-tags. However, these tags are extremely important for users with vision impairments as they might use a web screen reader which depends on the alt-tags to tell the user what content is being served on the web page. Additionally other things like font size and colors might decrease the overall accessibility of webpages.
Oink is a chrome extension that encompasses a suite of many different customizable features that helps tackle these problem by making websites more accessible and safe for all users. 

Oink's capabilities:
* auto-fills in missing alt tags for images using Google Cloud Vision API;
* modifies text appearance (increases font size, weight, color corrections);
* detecting audio playing on a website;
* filtering out content that the user specifies he/she is sensitive to.

We used this [bad site](https://github.com/meganung/badsite-example) to demo some of the many capabilities of Oink!
